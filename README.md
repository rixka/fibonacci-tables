# Coding Exercise - Fibonacci tables

## Introduction
This is an application that takes numeric input `n` from a user and outputs a multiplication table of (N) fibinacci numbers.

#### Example
Input: `n = 3`

Output:

|       |     1 |     1 |     2 |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **1** |     1 |     1 |     2 |
| **1** |     1 |     1 |     2 |
| **2** |    10 |    15 |     4 |

## Setup
Installation instructions.

`mix deps.get`

## Docs
Instructions to generate and access docs. _(link not available as this is an exercise_

```
mix docs
open docs/index.html
```

## Testing
Testing instructions.

`mix test`

## Notes
This project is designed to have modular components loosely coupled to ensure dependencies are kept to a minimum. The modularity of these components makes it easy to maintain and replace functions without it impacting too much on the remaining codebase.

## Future
This small project allowed for me to get more familiar with Elixir, next I would like to create a web app in Phoenix to serve as a UI.
